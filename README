#Notes
1. The first time the Lens is started, it will ask for your authorization
   to access your RTM account (read-only mode). Check your web browser,
   authorize it and click the icon :).
2. The first time the Lens is started, the "Sections" area will not
   contain any filters for categories. Just stop the lens (ctrl-c on the
   python process) and restart it to have full functionality.
